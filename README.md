### Concepts Involved

## Document Object Model (DOM) Manipulation

When the user will click on the next question button, the contents of the question and it's options will be changed.<br>

If user clicks on the correct option, score will be updated and all the other options would be disabled. Also text of the selected option would change to green color in case of correct answer selection and red color in case of wrong answer<br>

## Modules In Javascript

Code divided into different modules and those are imported as when required thereby ensuring readability and easy debugging.<br>

Made use of ES6 modules syntax.(import and export)

## Events

Click event is extensively used througout the application and most of the DOM manipulations happen when user clicks on any of the options and the next question button.<br>
